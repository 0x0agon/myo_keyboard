9/1/19 -- Fill out the Readme, fix issues with imports to myo-raw, and give more credit to the dependencies. Run keylogger and emg simultaneously, start looking for pattern, investigate using SciKit learn
9/8/19 -- Log emg and keylogger data to influx, start looking for patterns. Investigate SciKit learn, automate influx logging when exiting `run_loggers`
